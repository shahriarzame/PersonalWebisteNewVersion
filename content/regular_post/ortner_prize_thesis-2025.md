### A Special Recognition

I am deeply honored to share that the **Johannes B. Ortner-Stiftung** has awarded my master’s thesis with a prize for outstanding research by early-career scientists at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**.

The recognition comes with a prize of **€1,500**, following a nomination from the **TUM School of Engineering and Design** and confirmation by the foundation’s board.

### Award Ceremony

The official award will be conferred during the **TUM Awards Dinner** at the Hotel Bayerischer Hof, Munich, on **Thursday, 13 November 2025**. The event promises to be a memorable occasion celebrating achievements across the TUM community.

### Gratitude

This recognition would not have been possible without the support and guidance of mentors, colleagues, and peers who contributed to my academic journey. I am sincerely thankful for the encouragement and opportunities that shaped this work.
