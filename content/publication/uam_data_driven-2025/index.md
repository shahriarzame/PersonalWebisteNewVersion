abstract: >-
  This thesis presents an optimization-based siting framework for vertiports
  in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), explicitly incorporating both capacity and
  land-use considerations. Using Munich as a case study, the framework balances
  sustainability and efficiency objectives by integrating multi-objective
  decision-making with spatial data on demand, land use, and environmental
  constraints. Results highlight how incremental siting strategies can optimize
  accessibility while minimizing conflicts with urban land-use priorities,
  providing practical insights for the scalable deployment of UAM infrastructure.
