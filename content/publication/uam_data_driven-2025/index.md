abstract: >-
  This study systematically compares six clustering-based vertiport allocation strategies against an expert-defined benchmark (OBUAM) in the Munich Metropolitan Region. Travel-time efficiency, accessibility, and transport equity impacts are evaluated across scenarios. Clustering-based siting outperforms expert-defined siting on all three dimensions, with K-means++ achieving the highest travel time savings (10.05%), accessibility gains (7.16%), and the lowest Gini coefficient (0.512). Sensitivity analyses show that reducing pre-flight time has a larger impact than increasing cruise speed, while higher fares disproportionately reduce accessibility and equity.
