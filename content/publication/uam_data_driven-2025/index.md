abstract: >-
  This study systematically compares six clustering-based vertiport allocation
  strategies against an expert-defined benchmark (OBUAM) in the Munich
  Metropolitan Region. Travel-time efficiency, accessibility, and transport
  equity impacts are evaluated across scenarios. Clustering-based siting
  outperforms expert-defined siting on all three dimensions, with K-means++
  achieving the highest travel time savings (10.05%), accessibility gains
  (7.16%), and the lowest Gini coefficient (0.512). Sensitivity analyses show
  that reducing pre-flight time has a larger impact than increasing cruise
  speed, while higher fares disproportionately reduce accessibility and equity.
