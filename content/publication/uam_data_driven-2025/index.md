  Urban Air Mobility (UAM) has emerged as a promising solution to enhance metropolitan urban mobility. A critical determinant of UAMâ€™s success is vertiport siting, which directly influences accessibility and travel time benefits. However, existing research lacks an evaluation of different data-driven clustering approaches for vertiport placement. This study systematically compares six clustering-based vertiport allocation strategies against an expert-defined benchmark (OBUAM) in the Munich Metropolitan Region. Results show that clustering-based siting significantly outperforms expert-defined methods across travel time savings, accessibility improvements, and transport equity. The K-means++ approach delivered the highest travel time savings (10.05%), accessibility gains (7.16%), and the lowest Gini coefficient (0.512). Sensitivity analysis highlights that reducing pre-flight time has a more substantial impact than increasing cruise speed, whereas higher fares disproportionately reduce accessibility benefits and equity.
