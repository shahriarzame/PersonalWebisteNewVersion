abstract: >-
  This research presents a multi-objective optimization framework for
  incremental siting of capacitated vertiports that integrates real land-use
  data. Applied to the Munich metropolitan area, the four-phased strategy
  yields approximately €131,500 higher daily net profits, €15 tonnes in
  emissions reductions, and a 0.9 % increase in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) mode
  share. The analysis identifies a 20–40 % infrastructure cost subsidy as
  optimal to balance efficiency and economic feasibility.
